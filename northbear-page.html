    In the year-long class called Collaborative Project Development (DATT 3700), I worked under the Systems and Coding team as the Game Designer/Unity Technical Artist to realize a virtual reality game using Unity and HTC/Vive.

    WHAT IS NORTH BEAR?
		<br></br>
    North Bear is a virtual reality experience that is meant to put the user in the "shoes" or "paws" of the polar bear. Donning the virtual headset, the user becomes the polar bear who must navigate a constantly changing landscape of ice sheets and capture fish on their journey to the end goal of feeding themselves and their cubs.

    MY EXPERIENCE
		<br></br>
    Working in a group of 21 people, I was part of the Game Design team who were responsible for importing art assets into the Unity environment and creating the artistic vision of the project. I helped plan the artistic vision and direction by pitching asset design ideas such as the low-poly theme. In addition to, I created level designs using Adobe Illustrator.
    <br></br>
    Acting as a liaison between the Game Design team and the Art Assets team, I also ensured that the modelling/animation requests of the Game Design team were communicated to the Art Assets team lead.
