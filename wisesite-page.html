    With my role as the Treasure and Webmaster of WISE for the 2016-2017 year, I worked on website development projects for the club's personal site and for The Lady Hacks event site.

    I planned and set up the current club site at wise.lassonde.yorku.ca and The Lady Hacks site (I apologize, the domain is not available anymore!) using WordPress.
