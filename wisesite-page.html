    With my role as the Treasurer and Webmaster of WISE for the 2016-2017 year, I worked on website development projects for the club's personal site and for The Lady Hacks event site.

    I planned and set up the current club <a href="http://wise.lassonde.yorku.ca">site</a> and The Lady Hacks site using WordPress.
