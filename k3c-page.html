    Working with a group of 4 members, we created a 2D GameMaker vertical sidescroller game called Kitty Cat Catastrophic Catnundrum.
		<br></br>

    WHAT IS K3C?
		<br></br>
    Kitty Cat Catastrophic Catnundrum or K3C was created using GameMaker and coded in GameMaker's language, GML.
    <br></br>
    The game starts with a cat protagonist whose objective is to reach the top of the building, while avoiding or killing enemies (other cats, dogs, birds). Power-ups and object hindrances exist within the game to add challenge. If the cat protagonist reaches the end of the 3 levels, they are met with the boss level (a giant cat!) and upon victory, they will reach the rooftop and have a fan-cat-astic party.

    MY EXPERIENCE
		<br></br>
    I worked as the primary game programmer and I was responsible for coding enemy movements, level transitions, game elements such as health bars, power-ups and "power-downs", and the final boss level.
    <br></br>
    Learning the GML language from scratch was an added challenge but I adapted well (with the help of great tutorials and thorough Google searches) and I was able to code the team's game plans to reality and within deadline.
