	<p class="content-page-title">Hello, I'm Aubrey Mae Garcia</p>
	<br></br>
	<p class="content-page-text">
    Or you can call me Aubrey, for short.
    <br></br>
    I'm an aspiring designer/programmer/creator who is currently in the Digital Media program at York University, Toronto.
    <br></br>
    I am passionate about design compositions, colour combinations and nicely indented code. Drawing from my many inspirations in art, books and videogames, I like to create work that is fun, pleasing and unique. Well versed in both the arts and programming, I like to use code as another medium for art creation. I'm really digging <b>HTML</b>, <b>CSS</b>, and <b>Object-Oriented Programming</b> and I'm making my way to learning more <b>JavaScript</b> in order to make my code <i>really</i> come to life.
    <br></br>

  <h2><i>But, who are you really, Aubrey?</i></h2>
	<p class="content-page-text">
    Well, I’m your friendly neighbourhood spidergirl.
    <br></br>
    No, but I’m really just trying to find my way. Trying to find myself among the vast sea of programming languages. And if there's one thing I'm sure about, I love going on (sea) adventures.
    <br></br>

  <h2><i>So you like art + coding? How do you do that?</i></h2>
	<p class="content-page-text">
    Digital Media or computational arts opened a door for me upon accepting the offer in 2014. It opened the possibility for me to use both of my passions, art and programming, together. Consequently, I’ve had the pleasure to work on projects that let me do just that: I’ve taken roles as a game designer, a technical programmer, assets modeller and even as an art lead.
    <br></br>
    I love hats and I’m not afraid of wearing different ones.
    <br></br>
    These roles have helped my design and programming abilities to grow, in addition to my collaborative and leadership skills. Furthermore, it’s helped my self expression and adaptability to improve greatly. Due to this, I’m willing and able to tackle new challenges in new environments.
    <br></br>
    I also have different hobbies: I like to play the ukulele, play sports, and read comic books. Y'know, just your friendly neighbourhood spidergirl.
